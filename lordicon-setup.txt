To use Lordicon icons, you must load their player script in your HTML. Add this line to your <head> in index.html:

<script src="https://cdn.lordicon.com/lordicon.js"></script>

Example:
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://cdn.lordicon.com/lordicon.js"></script>
</head>

This enables the <lord-icon> custom element to render and animate in your React app.
